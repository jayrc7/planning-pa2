    ##       the first state and action in the list correspond to the initial state and action taken from
    ##       the initial state, and the last (s,a) pair has s as a goal state, and a=None, and the intermediate

    ## NOTE: The format of state is a tuple: (encoded_state, player_idx), where encoded_state is a tuple of 12 integers
    ##       (mirroring the contents of BoardState.state), and player_idx is 0 or 1, indicating the player that is
